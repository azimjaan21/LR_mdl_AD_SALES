Ad Sales Linear Regression Model

This project demonstrates how to use Linear Regression to predict sales based on advertising expenditure. By analyzing the relationship between ad spending across multiple channels (TV, radio, and newspaper) and resulting sales, the model aims to provide insights for optimizing marketing strategies. The dataset is used to build and evaluate the model, showcasing key metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error for performance evaluation.
